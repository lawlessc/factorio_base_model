# factorio_base_model
This just a basic 3d model for sprite creation in factorio. comes with necessary changes , such as orthographic projection ,semi transparent shadow and sun/camera at right angles etc. Also and an image to create an effect as if an enviroment is reflecting on it.

Still needs work on light temperature etc i think
